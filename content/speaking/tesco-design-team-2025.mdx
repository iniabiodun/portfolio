Led a 55-minute interactive session for Tesco's Design and Research team exploring practical AI integration in design practice.

The talk focused on real-world applications, demonstrated through live product builds and personal projects, moving beyond theory into actionable practice. Showcased how Intercom's design team ships production-ready code and prototypes using AI tools, including Staff Product Designer Domingo's banner audit, a script that parsed 700+ component variations in hours versus weeks manually.

Walked through the complete Fin Voice design process from concept to shipped product, demonstrating the workflow from Midjourney visual exploration to V0 prototyping to Cursor WebGL development. Showed how working prototypes shifted stakeholder conversations from "should we build?" to "when can we ship?"

Shared personal projects as practice: Pattern Generator (a custom tool built in Lovable for Youth Agency rebrand), Aivie (a medical living history app for chronic illness management), and the Maya Angelou Project (collaborating with my 6-year-old daughter using Claude voice mode).

Covered the AI tool stack like Claude, Cursor, V0, Distill, Perplexity, and addressed the human cost: themed work days, intentional boundaries, and scheduling learning into work hours.

Ran a workshop helping attendees write their first AI-assisted prototype brief, focusing on what to test, who needs to see it, and what conversation it will unlock.

Core principles shared: claiming permission (build prototypes before seeking approval), tight feedback loops (bring stakeholders in earlier), compounding leverage (one prototype unlocks multiple conversations), practice over privilege (consistent daily practice compounds over time), and generous knowledge sharing (document and share prompts, processes, and failures).
