Tesco Design Team | November 28, 2025

## Overview

Led a 55-minute interactive session for Tesco's Design and Research team exploring practical AI integration in design practice. The talk focused on real-world applications, demonstrated through live product builds and personal projects, moving beyond theory into actionable practice.

## How Intercom Defaults to AI

Showcased how the design team ships production-ready code and prototypes using AI tools

Demonstrated Staff Product Designer Domingo's banner audit: a script that parsed 700+ component variations in hours (vs. weeks manually)

Shared Intercom's rapid evolution from ChatGPT's launch to building Fin Voice in six weeks

## Product Feature Development: Fin Voice

Walked through the complete design process from concept to shipped product (September 4 - October 9, 2024)

Demonstrated workflow: Midjourney visual exploration → V0 prototyping → Cursor WebGL development

Showed how working prototypes shifted stakeholder conversations from "should we build?" to "when can we ship?"

Live demo of particle system interactions and voice visualization techniques

## Personal Projects as Practice

Pattern Generator: Custom tool built in Lovable for Youth Agency rebrand, enabling non-designers to create brand assets independently

Aivie: Medical living history app for chronic illness management, featuring voice-based logging and AI-powered symptom tracking

Maya Angelou Project: Collaborated with 6-year-old daughter using Claude voice mode, demonstrating how she directed the AI rather than asking it for help

## AI Tool Stack & Sustainable Practice

Core tools: Claude (collaboration), Cursor (prototyping), V0 (visual prototypes), Distill (idea capture), Perplexity (research)

Demonstrated Distill + Wispr Flow workflow for early morning brain dumps and idea synthesis

Addressed the human cost: themed work days, intentional boundaries, and scheduling learning into work hours

## Workshop: First Prototype Brief

Interactive exercise helping attendees write a 3-sentence brief for their first AI-assisted prototype

Framework focused on: what to test, who needs to see it, and what conversation it will unlock

## Core Principles Shared

Claiming Permission: Build prototypes before seeking approval to accelerate decision-making

Tight Feedback Loops: Bring stakeholders in earlier with tangible, interactive prototypes

Compounding Leverage: One prototype unlocks multiple conversations and directions

Practice Over Privilege: Consistent daily practice (even 10 minutes) compounds over time

Generous Knowledge Sharing: Document and share prompts, processes, and failures to lift the community

## Format

Expert demonstration with live prototypes, screen recordings of real workflows, interactive workshop element, and open Q&A discussion focusing on practical blockers and implementation strategies.
