Joined Sophie Aldebert's charitable UX event alongside designers and researchers from Tesco, Lloyd's Bank, Cleo, and Jaguar Land Rover to discuss creativity beyond the brief.

We explored how to stay innovative within real-world constraints such as legacy systems, slow organisational change, and the pressure to ship at speed. I spoke about building in public at Intercom, where the lines between design, research, and engineering have completely blurred. Shared how we're prototyping AI features with Claude and Cursor, sometimes shipping directly from what started as experiments, collapsing the distance between idea and validation from weeks to hours.

Discussed my neurodivergent creative process: the stakeholder maps I build to read organisational dynamics, the systems I've designed to do what others do intuitively. For me, constraints redirect creativity, not limit it.

Closed on the philosophy behind In Good Company: your process is an act of generosity. The designers getting ahead aren't waiting for perfect conditions or formal permission. They're building in public, showing messy middles, creating luck surface area through visible practice.

The advice I gave young designers: don't wait to design beyond the brief. Build the work you wish existed. Ship something imperfect this week.
