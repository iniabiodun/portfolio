Here's what Sophie had to say.

Joined designers and researchers from Tesco, Lloyd's Bank, Cleo, and Jaguar Land Rover to discuss creativity beyond the brief—how we stay innovative within real-world constraints like legacy systems, slow organizational change, and the pressure to ship at speed.

I spoke about building in public at Intercom, where the lines between design, research, and engineering have completely blurred. Shared how we're prototyping AI features with Claude and Cursor, sometimes shipping directly from what started as experiments—collapsing the distance between idea and validation from weeks to hours.

Discussed my neurodivergent creative process: the stakeholder maps I build to read organizational dynamics, the systems I've designed to do what others do intuitively. Argued that constraints don't limit creativity—they redirect it. When you can't change the pace of organizational change, you make practice your competitive advantage.

Closed on the philosophy behind In Good Company: your process is an act of generosity. The designers getting ahead aren't waiting for perfect conditions or formal permission. They're building in public, showing messy middles, creating luck surface area through visible practice.

The advice I gave young designers: don't wait to design beyond the brief. Build the work you wish existed. Ship something imperfect this week. Practice is the new privilege—and the gap between those actively experimenting versus those waiting for permission is growing exponentially.
