Designers often feel like order takers, struggling to gain buy-in for their ideas, without truly influencing key stakeholders or the product strategy. Together, we will explore the power of "pre-work" – the strategic groundwork before presenting design solutions.

Learn how to build rapport, understand organizational dynamics, and tailor your communication to influence decision-makers effectively.

Using real-world examples and actionable frameworks, this talk empowers designers to become more effective communicators and drive meaningful change within their organisations.
