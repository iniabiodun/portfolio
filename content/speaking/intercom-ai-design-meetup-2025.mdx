It's happening! Intercom's launching AI Design Meetups in London and we're hoping to have these regularly.

For our first one, come discover how designers are leveraging AI to accelerate prototyping, bridge the code gap, push creative limits and think about how AI design will transform the design role in the future.

Speakers will share how they're making AI work for them in their daily design practice.

We will have:

- Nathalie K. (Figma)

- ⁠Heldiney Pereira (Monzo)

- ⁠Ioana Teleanu (ex-Miro)

- ⁠Domingo Widen (Intercom)

- ⁠James Cash (Intercom)

- ⁠Daria V. (Intercom)

You can expect punchy talks and live demos and plenty of "wait, can you show that again?" moments as we explore what AI-powered design means today.

When: Wednesday, 22 October, 2025

Where: 9th Floor, The Warehouse, 211 Old Street, London, EC1V 9NR

Doors open at 6:30 pm. Talks start at 7 and we wrap at 9:30pm. Food and drinks on us!
