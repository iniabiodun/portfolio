title: "Soft Skills, Sharp Tools: Making AI Work for People"

The more we experiment with tools, the more an old tension becomes impossible to ignore.

The ability to frame problems clearly.

The ability to earn trust early.

The ability to hold alignment when bots can draft, iterate, and prototype in seconds.

That human layer of emotional intelligence is the real work.

Without it, teams over index on automation and slide straight back into order taker mode. With it, AI becomes a strategic amplifier instead of a shortcut.

I shared how we approach machine collaboration in real projects at Intercom, how we use AI to stretch ideas, and why, in my opinion, soft skills remain the backbone of AI native design.
