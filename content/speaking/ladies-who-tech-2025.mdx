Spoke at Ladies Who Tech: AI Era on the AI for Human Skills track, exploring why emotional intelligence remains the backbone of AI-native design.

The more we experiment with tools, the more an old tension point becomes impossible to ignore; the ability to frame problems clearly, earn trust early, and hold alignment when bots can draft, iterate, and prototype in seconds. That human layer of emotional intelligence is the real work.

Without it, teams over-index on automation and slide straight back into order-taker mode. With it, AI becomes a strategic amplifier instead of a shortcut.

I shared how we approach machine collaboration in real projects at Intercom, how we use AI to stretch ideas, and why soft skills remain the foundation of meaningful design work.
