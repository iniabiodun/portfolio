A few weeks ago at Intercom's AI Design Meetup, I casually mentioned wanting to gather designers who are actually building with AI outside of work.

Designers shipping things, experimenting, and learning in public together.

Sakky B immediately offered to host. And so, last night happened.

And boy, it went deep. Product concepts with full technical architecture from Uchechukwu Onyeka. Find a cheeky Designers doing cool shit in his product 😅

We shared techniques we're using in our work - like role playing with AI personas, feedback on visual direction, branding choices, market positioning.

Safe conversations about what's working and what's not. What we're excited about and unsure of.

I left feeling so at peace. So nourished. And convinced we need more nights/community like this. If you're interested in our next Designers doing cool shit, send me a message - tbc@iniabiodun.com
