## Challenge

Chronic pain is unpredictable. Patients struggle to identify triggers, can't articulate patterns to doctors, and lack tools to predict flares before they happen. Existing solutions focus on retrospective logging—tracking what already occurred—rather than predictive intelligence.

The design challenge: create a low-friction logging system (critical when users are in pain) that surfaces insights they couldn't catch manually, then translates lived experience into medical language providers actually understand.

## Approach

### Pattern Recognition Interface

Designed daily check-in system tracking pain levels, activities, environmental factors, and emotional state. AI analyzes correlations users miss; sleep quality vs. pain intensity three days later, weather patterns, medication effectiveness. Interface prioritizes speed (under 30 seconds per log) while capturing meaningful data.

### Predictive Intelligence

Built prediction layer surfacing early warning signals. System learns individual patterns and alerts users: "Based on your last three days, higher pain likely tomorrow." Allows proactive intervention rather than reactive management.

### Medical Translation

Converts patient language into clinical terminology. Transforms "really bad stabbing pain that comes and goes" into structured symptom descriptions doctors need for diagnosis. Exports summary reports for appointments.

## Technical Execution

Built with Claude API, Next.js, and SwiftUI. Currently in private beta with users managing various chronic conditions.
