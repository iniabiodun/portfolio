### Establishing Mental Models for AI Agent Activation

Led product design for Fin AI Agent onboarding experience, addressing fragmentation that caused mid-market customers to stall mid-setup. Designed unified learning-to-deployment flows that transformed scattered documentation into actionable habit-building systems. Cross-functional work with PM, Engineering, Content Education, Customer Success, and Sales.

## Challenge

Mid-market customers (1-15k conversations) were starting Fin setup but dropping off before activation. The experience was fragmented across multiple surfaces with no clear path forward. Early data and customer feedback showed:

- Low activation rates despite strong marketing interest

- Scattered touchpoints created confusion about "what to do next"

- Customers skipping content preparation and testing phases entirely

- "Fin doesn't work" complaints traced back to poor content quality

Customers needed to understand that Fin's performance depended on their content quality and testing habits, but the existing experience treated these as optional steps rather than critical foundations. Setup felt like checking boxes, not building a reliable support system.

## Approach

I developed "Learn + Task + In-Context Guidance" methodology using habit-building loops. Customers start with educational content paired with immediate in-product tasks.

I designed visual nudge systems (sidebar widgets + animated in-product cues) making core actions discoverable without being intrusive. I introduced a unified surface, with clear entry points into the product and an opinionated guide to setting up Fin replacing scattered documentation.
