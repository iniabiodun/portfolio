### Designing Trust for AI Voice Agents

Led interaction and product design for Fin Voice's public launch, positioning AI voice agents for customer support—one of CX's highest-stakes, highest-emotion touchpoints. Cross-functional partnership with PM, Engineering, AI Research, and Brand.

## Challenge

CX leaders were skeptical about AI handling live phone conversations. Early research revealed three barriers: uncertainty about AI capabilities, "bot anxiety" about emotional situations, and confusion about business control. The product page needed to build trust in seconds.

## Outcome

Fin Voice launched at Pioneer 2025. Demo interface patterns established baseline for communicating AI intelligence deeper in Intercom products.

## Strategic Approach

### Trust Architecture

Mapped four trust layers required for adoption:

- capability (does it understand?),

- control (can we govern it?),

- transparency (what's happening under the hood?), and

- risk reduction (what breaks safely?).

This framework shaped every design decision, from messaging hierarchy to demo interaction patterns. Worked with Product Marketing to ensure messaging addressed skepticism head-on rather than avoiding it.

## Design Solutions

### Product Page Structure

Designed three-tier narrative: immediate capability proof (hero demo), transparency layer (how it works), control layer (integrations). Each section answered a specific trust question identified in research. Navigation allowed CX leaders to jump directly to their primary concern.

### Visual Language

Created 3D particle-based sound visualization for hero section. Built custom Python tool converting images to 66,000+ particle coordinates, prototyped WebGL interactions showing aurora-like waves that disperse and reform. Avoided generic waveforms; captured how sound moves through space. Handed working prototype to Frontend for production integration with Pioneer 2025 brand.

## Cross-Functional Leadership

- With AI Research: Translated technical capabilities into customer-facing benefit language. Identified which AI behaviours to expose vs. abstract.

- With PM: Aligned page goals with sales pipeline needs. Prioritised demo requests and qualified lead capture over broad awareness.

- With Brand: Integrated Fin Voice into Pioneer 2025's surreal visual language while maintaining product clarity.

## Key Learning

Trust in AI voice isn't built through feature lists. Demonstrating control, visible reasoning and making AI feel governable was the core challenge; not making it feel human.
