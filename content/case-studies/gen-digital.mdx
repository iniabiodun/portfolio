### Scaling Growth Strategy Across 58 Markets

Led product design strategy as Principal Product Designer for Norton AntiVirus, serving 500M+ global users and 6k+ businesses. Entered engineering and business-led organization with no established design authority. Built intent-based segmentation framework transforming acquisition across 58 markets. Cross-functional leadership and partnership with Marketing, Product, Engineering, Regional Market Heads, VP, Design and CPO.

### Challenge

Gen Digital faced an acquisition crisis threatening business viability. Despite years of optimization, paid traffic converted at only 8%; mobile was catastrophic at 4.2%.

The core problem: 93% of traffic forced through identical flows regardless of user intent. Markets operated in silos, running isolated experiments with no shared learnings. Resources wasted on redundant tests. Insights didn't transfer across brands or regions. Cybersecurity had commoditised, margins were shrinking, and acquisition couldn't sustain growth.

Above all, there was no clear sense of design/user experience input as the organisation was largely engineering and business-led. The business needed: unified user classification, scalable learnings architecture, design system working across mobile/desktop and 58 markets with varying maturity, and cross-functional alignment on single strategy.

### Strategic Approach

**Intent-Based Segmentation Framework**

Analyzed behavioural data, path analysis, and funnel drop-offs across high-volume markets (US, UK, Germany, Brazil, India). Identified three consistent behavioural segments emerging globally:

- **Branded Traffic:** High intent, comparing vendors. Needs clarity, not persuasion.
- **Non-Branded Traffic:** Early discovery, skeptical. Requires trust building before purchase consideration.
- **Anxiety-Driven Traffic:** Immediate threat response ("remove virus"). Needs fast reassurance, not product tours.

**Cross-Functional Alignment**

Led strategic workshops in Prague with sales, marketing, product leaders, and regional representatives. Mapped local constraints, applied segmentation to real traffic patterns, identified high-leverage intervention points per segment. Used effort-impact matrices for shared prioritization.

**Technical Architecture Mapping**

Mapped Adobe Target capabilities, server-side decisioning constraints, billing dependencies, and component libraries across Norton/Avast/AVG brands. This revealed 4-5 systemic interventions that could scale globally, replacing hundreds of isolated A/B tests:

- High-intent plan comparison modules
- Credibility blocks for non-branded users
- Low-pressure CTAs for exploratory traffic
- Mobile-optimized layouts decoupled from desktop patterns
- Localization logic for pricing and plan selection

### Design Solutions

**Track 1: Branded Traffic Optimization**

For high-intent users already comparing vendors, we replaced marketing persuasion with decision clarity.

I designed lightweight plan comparison charts above fold, pricing/feature clarity at glance. (20% increase in revenue per visitor, 10.1% conversion lift, 18% increase in overall revenue.)

**Track 2: Non-Branded Traffic Strategy**

Non-branded visitors bounced immediately due to sales pressure on arrival.

I designed trust-leaning pages introducing credibility signals (user counts, testimonials, security certifications), educational framing over selling, low-commitment CTAs ("Learn more" not "Buy now").

Results: 10% RPV increase, 5.2% cart conversion improvement, significant bounce rate reduction.

**Track 3: Mobile-First Redesign**

Mobile converting at 4.2% required complete rethinking—not desktop patterns crammed into small screens.

I designed mobile-native layouts prioritizing thumb zones, progressive disclosure for feature comparison, streamlined checkout removing desktop assumptions.

### Cross-Functional Leadership

**With Marketing & Regional Teams:** Workshops aligning 58 markets on shared strategy while respecting local constraints. This became the foundation on which we built quarterly plans using segmentation framework.

**With Engineering:** Worked with engineering to build Adobe Target decisioning logic supporting segment-based routing at scale and checkout enablement.

**With Product & CPO:** Elevated design from service function to strategic partner. Presented frameworks that CPO adopted company-wide for how product, design, and engineering collaborate. Processes became standard across 120-person design org.

**Design Leadership:** Mentored senior designers toward staff-level work without direct reports. Ran 100+ designer session on "Leading Without Authority." Shaped career ladders with Global Design Director. Established design ops processes enabling team to scale impact.

### Outcome

- **79.75% conversion uplift** across global markets—shifting acquisition ROI from negative to positive. Enabled funding for new growth channels, stabilized mobile-heavy regions.
- Evolved into **shared component libraries** offering reusable, proven UI modules. Markets inherited patterns instead of reinventing, eliminating redundant experimentation.
- **Organizational transformation:** Design became strategic partner in quarterly business planning, market strategy alignment, experimentation infrastructure, and cross-functional decision making.
- **Revenue impact:** $XXM+ revenue protection through systematic conversion improvements. Mobile performance reached parity with desktop in key markets.
