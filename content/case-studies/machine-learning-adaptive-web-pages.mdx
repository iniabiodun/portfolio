I led the creation of Intercom's first adaptive direct-response landing page system for Fin AI Agent, and contributed to its evolution into a multi-phase platform that powers the performance layer of fin.ai across GTM, Growth, Web, and Product.

Over six months, this work evolved from urgent 0→1 page builds into a CMS-driven, machine-learning powered acquisition system used by sales, demand gen, and product marketing teams.

## Executive Summary

- Designed and shipped 12 DRLPs in two weeks as our first GTM surfaces for Fin AI Agent,
- Contributed to its evolution into a componentised CMS system in Sanity to enable rapid GTM iteration,
- Designed an ML-powered adaptive version that changes page structure in real time based on user intent and profiles,
- Lifted DRLPs to 10%+ CTA rates (compared to 4% on the main site pages) with DRLP traffic now represents 70% of paid acquisition for Fin.

## Context

In early 2025, Fin AI Agent got its own home, separate from Intercom's main site. This meant the GTM team suddenly had:

- no dedicated fin.ai website,
- no acquisition surfaces,
- no performance-ready design system.

We needed a fully functioning DRLP ecosystem within weeks.

## Challenge

DRLP performance was critical: nearly all paid and organic traffic would land here. Different queries ("AI agent", "AI customer service", "live chat software") produced wildly different intent.

Sales and Demand Gen needed pages they could modify without design input.

ML risk signals had to influence page behaviour live.

## Approach

### Phase 1 — 0→1 DRLP System (2 weeks)

I designed and shipped 12 pages with:

- a unified structure,
- performance-first interaction patterns,
- high-velocity components later ported to Sanity,
- CTA logic optimised around Fin's two revenue drivers (trial + demo)

**Key impact:**

These pages outperformed the intercom.com equivalents, hitting 10%+ CTA rates.

### Phase 2 — ML Adaptive Pages (The Performance Layer)

This was the most innovative part of the system. Using internal tech built by a brilliant product engineer, the design became an adaptive layer that could:

- identify high-risk or high-value traffic in real time,
- adjust layout, ordering, and messaging,
- personalise content blocks,

All to drive our push to trial/demo to increase conversions.

### Phase 3: Componentising into Sanity (CMS)

Bringing a performance lens to the components, I paired with another designer to rebuild the DRLP components into a CMS system that GTM teams could use with reduced design and engineering handoff.

This included:

- layouts variants,
- plan comparison blocks,
- credibility sections,
- testimonials
- ML conditional content buckets
- mobile-first variants

This system would form a foundational part of the fin.ai's web design system.

## Performance & Results

- 70% of paid traffic now lands on DRLP system
- 10%+ average CTA rate across pages (2.5× the main site)
- System now used across web, sales, product marketing, and growth.
