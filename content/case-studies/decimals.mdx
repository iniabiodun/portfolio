## Challenge

Technical hiring is broken. Recruiters don't understand roles, ATS systems filter out qualified candidates, and interview processes waste everyone's time. Meanwhile, high-caliber talent want direct access to companies worth working for, minus the endless screening calls.

The design challenge: create a marketplace where power dynamics flip. Companies pitch to candidates, not vice versa. But how do you design credibility signals for both sides when there's no traditional application/resume exchange?

## Approach

### Role Reversal Interface

Designed dual experience: candidates sign up through vetted experts, browse companies and request conversations; hiring managers pitch their team/projects/culture to attract interest.

Candidates define themselves through work samples, projects, and stated preferences. Companies earn the right to candidates' time.

### Trust Architecture

Built vetting system ensuring "high-caliber" meant something concrete. Candidates are curated by domain expertise, companies are verified by team members, reducing mismatches.

### Conversation-First Flow

Designed around actual dialogue, not forms. Interview becomes discovery conversation with parties evaluating fit simultaneously.
