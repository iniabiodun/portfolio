Zero-to-one product design and development.</p>\n<video src=\"https://wg3rkolxoqlklarv.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Aivie.mp4\" autoplay loop muted playsinline class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\"></video>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\n<p>Chronic pain is unpredictable. Patients struggle to identify triggers, can't articulate patterns to doctors, and lack tools to predict flares before they happen. Existing solutions focus on retrospective logging—tracking what already occurred—rather than predictive intelligence.</p>\n<p>The design challenge: create a low-friction logging system (critical when users are in pain) that surfaces insights they couldn't catch manually, then translates lived experience into medical language providers actually understand.</p>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Approach</h2>\n<h3>Pattern Recognition Interface</h3>\n<p>Designed daily check-in system tracking pain levels, activities, environmental factors, and emotional state. AI analyzes correlations users miss; sleep quality vs. pain intensity three days later, weather patterns, medication effectiveness. Interface prioritizes speed (under 30 seconds per log) while capturing meaningful data.</p>\n<h3>Predictive Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Built prediction layer surfacing early warning signals. System learns individual patterns and alerts users: \"Based on your last three days, higher pain likely tomorrow.\" Allows proactive intervention rather than reactive management.</p>\n<h3>Medical Translation</h3>\n<p>Converts patient language into clinical terminology. Transforms \"really bad stabbing pain that comes and goes\" into structured symptom descriptions doctors need for diagnosis. Exports summary reports for appointments.</p>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Technical Execution</h2>\n<p>Built with Claude API, Next.js, and SwiftUI. Currently in private beta with users managing various chronic conditions.</p>\n<img src=\"/Aivie-first-ad.png\" alt=\"Aivie First Ad\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"

Recruiters don't understand roles, ATS systems filter out qualified candidates, and interview processes waste everyone's time. Meanwhile, high-caliber talent want direct access to companies worth working for, minus the endless screening calls.</p>\n<p>The design challenge: create a marketplace where power dynamics flip. Companies pitch to candidates, not vice versa. But how do you design credibility signals for both sides when there's no traditional application/resume exchange?</p>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Approach</h2>\n<h3>Role Reversal Interface</h3>\n<p>Designed dual experience: candidates sign up through vetted experts, browse companies and request conversations; hiring managers pitch their team/projects/culture to attract interest.</p>\n<p>Candidates define themselves through work samples, projects, and stated preferences. Companies earn the right to candidates' time.</p>\n<img src=\"/Decimals%20Candidate.png\" alt=\"Decimals Candidate Experience\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<h3>Trust Architecture</h3>\n<p>Built vetting system ensuring \"high-caliber\" meant something concrete.

Interview becomes discovery conversation with parties evaluating fit simultaneously.</p>\n<img src=\"/Decimals%20Hiring%20Managers.png\" alt=\"Decimals Hiring Manager\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<h2>Outcome</h2>\n<p>A fast-growing community of design talent and companies connecting directly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://decimals.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visit live site</a></p>\n<img src=\"/decimals-OG-image.png\" alt=\"Decimals OG Image\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"

Customers start with educational content paired with immediate in-product tasks.</p>\n<p>I designed visual nudge systems (sidebar widgets + animated in-product cues) making core actions discoverable without being intrusive. I introduced a unified surface, with clear entry points into the product and an opinionated guide to setting up Fin replacing scattered documentation.</p>\n<p><em>Full project and outcomes available on request.</em></p>"

Demo interface patterns established baseline for communicating AI intelligence deeper in Intercom products.</p>\n<h2>Strategic Approach</h2>\n<h3>Trust Architecture</h3>\n<p>Mapped four trust layers required for adoption:</p>\n<ul><li>capability (does it understand?),</li></ul>\n<ul><li>control (can we govern it?),</li></ul>\n<ul><li>transparency (what's happening under the hood?), and</li></ul>\n<ul><li>risk reduction (what breaks safely?).</li></ul>\n<p>This framework shaped every design decision, from messaging hierarchy to demo interaction patterns. Worked with Product Marketing to ensure messaging addressed skepticism head-on rather than avoiding it.</p>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Design Solutions</h2>\n<h3>Product Page Structure</h3>\n<p>Designed three-tier narrative: immediate capability proof (hero demo), transparency layer (how it works), control layer (integrations). Each section answered a specific trust question identified in research. Navigation allowed CX leaders to jump directly to their primary concern.</p>\n<h3>Visual Language</h3>\n<p>Created 3D particle-based sound visualization for hero section. Built custom Python tool converting images to 66,000+ particle coordinates, prototyped WebGL interactions showing aurora-like waves that disperse and reform.

Despite years of optimization, paid traffic converted at only 8%; mobile was catastrophic at 4.2%.</p>\n<p>The core problem: 93% of traffic forced through identical flows regardless of user intent. Markets operated in silos, running isolated experiments with no shared learnings. Resources wasted on redundant tests. Insights didn't transfer across brands or regions. Cybersecurity had commoditised, margins were shrinking, and acquisition couldn't sustain growth.</p>\n<p>Above all, there was no clear sense of design/user experience input as the organisation was largely engineering and business-led. The business needed: unified user classification, scalable learnings architecture, design system working across mobile/desktop and 58 markets with varying maturity, and cross-functional alignment on single strategy.</p>\n<img src=\"/Gen%20case%20study_%20voice%20of%20the%20customer.png\" alt=\"Voice of the Customer\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h3>Strategic Approach</h3>\n<p><strong class=\"font-semibold\">Intent-Based Segmentation Framework</strong></p>\n<p>Analyzed behavioural data, path analysis, and funnel drop-offs across high-volume markets (US, UK, Germany, Brazil, India).

This meant the GTM team suddenly had:</p>\n<ul><li>no dedicated fin.ai website,</li><li>no acquisition surfaces,</li><li>no performance-ready design system.</li></ul>\n<p>We needed a fully functioning DRLP ecosystem within weeks.</p>\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\n<p>DRLP performance was critical: nearly all paid and organic traffic would land here.
