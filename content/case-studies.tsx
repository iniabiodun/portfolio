Zero-to-one product design and development.</p>\n<video src=\"https://wg3rkolxoqlklarv.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Aivie.mp4\" autoplay loop muted playsinline class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\"></video>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\n<p>Chronic pain is unpredictable. Patients struggle to identify triggers, can't articulate patterns to doctors, and lack tools to predict flares before they happen. Existing solutions focus on retrospective logging—tracking what already occurred—rather than predictive intelligence.</p>\n<p>The design challenge: create a low-friction logging system (critical when users are in pain) that surfaces insights they couldn't catch manually, then translates lived experience into medical language providers actually understand.</p>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Approach</h2>\n<h3>Pattern Recognition Interface</h3>\n<p>Designed daily check-in system tracking pain levels, activities, environmental factors, and emotional state. AI analyzes correlations users miss; sleep quality vs. pain intensity three days later, weather patterns, medication effectiveness. Interface prioritizes speed (under 30 seconds per log) while capturing meaningful data.</p>\n<h3>Predictive Intelligence</h3>\n<p>Built prediction layer surfacing early warning signals. System learns individual patterns and alerts users: \"Based on your last three days, higher pain likely tomorrow.\" Allows proactive intervention rather than reactive management.</p>\n<h3>Medical Translation</h3>\n<p>Converts patient language into clinical terminology. Transforms \"really bad stabbing pain that comes and goes\" into structured symptom descriptions doctors need for diagnosis. Exports summary reports for appointments.</p>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Technical Execution</h2>\n<p>Built with Claude API, Next.js, and SwiftUI. Currently in private beta with users managing various chronic conditions.</p>\n<img src=\"/Aivie-first-ad.png\" alt=\"Aivie First Ad\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"

Recruiters don't understand roles, ATS systems filter out qualified candidates, and interview processes waste everyone's time. Meanwhile, high-caliber talent want direct access to companies worth working for, minus the endless screening calls.</p>\n<p>The design challenge: create a marketplace where power dynamics flip. Companies pitch to candidates, not vice versa. But how do you design credibility signals for both sides when there's no traditional application/resume exchange?</p>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Approach</h2>\n<h3>Role Reversal Interface</h3>\n<p>Designed dual experience: candidates sign up through vetted experts, browse companies and request conversations; hiring managers pitch their team/projects/culture to attract interest.</p>\n<p>Candidates define themselves through work samples, projects, and stated preferences. Companies earn the right to candidates' time.</p>\n<img src=\"/Decimals%20Candidate.png\" alt=\"Decimals Candidate Experience\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<h3>Trust Architecture</h3>\n<p>Built vetting system ensuring \"high-caliber\" meant something concrete. Candidates are curated by domain expertise, companies are verified by team members, reducing mismatches.</p>\n<h3>Conversation-First Flow</h3>\n<p>Designed around actual dialogue, not forms. Interview becomes discovery conversation with parties evaluating fit simultaneously.</p>\n<img src=\"/Decimals%20Hiring%20Managers.png\" alt=\"Decimals Hiring Manager\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<h2>Outcome</h2>\n<p>A fast-growing community of design talent and companies connecting directly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://decimals.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visit live site</a></p>\n<img src=\"/decimals-OG-image.png\" alt=\"Decimals OG Image\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"

The experience was fragmented across multiple surfaces with no clear path forward. Early data and customer feedback showed:</p>\n<ul><li>Low activation rates despite strong marketing interest</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Scattered touchpoints created confusion about \"what to do next\"</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Customers skipping content preparation and testing phases entirely</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\"Fin doesn't work\" complaints traced back to poor content quality</li></ul>\n<p>Customers needed to understand that Fin's performance depended on their content quality and testing habits, but the existing experience treated these as optional steps rather than critical foundations. Setup felt like checking boxes, not building a reliable support system.</p>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Approach</h2>\n<p>I developed \"Learn + Task + In-Context Guidance\" methodology using habit-building loops. Customers start with educational content paired with immediate in-product tasks.</p>\n<p>I designed visual nudge systems (sidebar widgets + animated in-product cues) making core actions discoverable without being intrusive. I introduced a unified surface, with clear entry points into the product and an opinionated guide to setting up Fin replacing scattered documentation.</p>\n<p><em>Full project and outcomes available on request.</em></p>"

Early research revealed three barriers: uncertainty about AI capabilities, \"bot anxiety\" about emotional situations, and confusion about business control. The product page needed to build trust in seconds.</p>\n<h2>Outcome</h2>\n<p>Fin Voice launched at Pioneer 2025. Demo interface patterns established baseline for communicating AI intelligence deeper in Intercom products.</p>\n<h2>Strategic Approach</h2>\n<h3>Trust Architecture</h3>\n<p>Mapped four trust layers required for adoption:</p>\n<ul><li>capability (does it understand?),</li></ul>\n<ul><li>control (can we govern it?),</li></ul>\n<ul><li>transparency (what's happening under the hood?), and</li></ul>\n<ul><li>risk reduction (what breaks safely?).</li></ul>\n<p>This framework shaped every design decision, from messaging hierarchy to demo interaction patterns. Worked with Product Marketing to ensure messaging addressed skepticism head-on rather than avoiding it.</p>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Design Solutions</h2>\n<h3>Product Page Structure</h3>\n<p>Designed three-tier narrative: immediate capability proof (hero demo), transparency layer (how it works), control layer (integrations). Each section answered a specific trust question identified in research. Navigation allowed CX leaders to jump directly to their primary concern.</p>\n<h3>Visual Language</h3>\n<p>Created 3D particle-based sound visualization for hero section. Built custom Python tool converting images to 66,000+ particle coordinates, prototyped WebGL interactions showing aurora-like waves that disperse and reform. Avoided generic waveforms; captured how sound moves through space. Handed working prototype to Frontend for production integration with Pioneer 2025 brand.</p>\n<video src=\"https://wg3rkolxoqlklarv.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Fin%20Hero%20p5.js%20animation-social.mp4\" autoplay loop muted playsinline class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\"></video>\n<hr class=\"my-8 border-t border-border\" />\n<h2>Cross-Functional Leadership</h2>\n<ul><li>With AI Research: Translated technical capabilities into customer-facing benefit language.

This meant the GTM team suddenly had:</p>\n<ul><li>no dedicated fin.ai website,</li><li>no acquisition surfaces,</li><li>no performance-ready design system.</li></ul>\n<p>We needed a fully functioning DRLP ecosystem within weeks.</p>\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\n<p>DRLP performance was critical: nearly all paid and organic traffic would land here. Different queries (\"AI agent\", \"AI customer service\", \"live chat software\") produced wildly different intent.</p>\n<p>Sales and Demand Gen needed pages they could modify without design input.</p>\n<p>ML risk signals had to influence page behaviour live.</p>\n<h2>Approach</h2>\n<h3>Phase 1 — 0→1 DRLP System (2 weeks)</h3>\n<p>I designed and shipped 12 pages with:</p>\n<ul><li>a unified structure,</li><li>performance-first interaction patterns,</li><li>high-velocity components later ported to Sanity,</li><li>CTA logic optimised around Fin's two revenue drivers (trial + demo)</li></ul>\n<p>*<em>Key impact:</em>*</p>\n<p>These pages outperformed the intercom.com equivalents, hitting 10%+ CTA rates.</p>\n<h3>Phase 2 — ML Adaptive Pages (The Performance Layer)</h3>\n<p>This was the most innovative part of the system. Using internal tech built by a brilliant product engineer, the design became an adaptive layer that could:</p>\n<ul><li>identify high-risk or high-value traffic in real time,</li><li>adjust layout, ordering, and messaging,</li><li>personalise content blocks,</li></ul>\n<p>All to drive our push to trial/demo to increase conversions.</p>\n<h3>Phase 3: Componentising into Sanity (CMS)</h3>\n<p>Bringing a performance lens to the components, I paired with another designer to rebuild the DRLP components into a CMS system that GTM teams could use with reduced design and engineering handoff.</p>\n<p>This included:</p>\n<ul><li>layouts variants,</li><li>plan comparison blocks,</li><li>credibility sections,</li><li>testimonials</li><li>ML conditional content buckets</li><li>mobile-first variants</li></ul>\n<p>This system would form a foundational part of the fin.ai's web design system.</p>\n<h2>Performance &amp; Results</h2>\n<ul><li>70% of paid traffic now lands on DRLP system</li><li>10%+ average CTA rate across pages (2.5× the main site)</li><li>System now used across web, sales, product marketing, and growth.</li></ul>"
