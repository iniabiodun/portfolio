[Read here](https://iniabiodun.substack.com/p/you-are-not-a-tree-move).*</blockquote>\n<p>I said this to a friend earlier this week. They were describing how they felt in a situation that was not of their making.</p>\n<p>But as they talked, I could hear something else beneath: a familiar kind of paralysis, a waiting for the right moment or the right permission or the right conditions.</p>\n<p>The question isn't whether you're stuck. Lots of us get stuck, through circumstances we didn't choose and couldn't prevent. The question is: what separates people who find a way to move from people who stay stuck?</p>\n<p>I've been thinking about this a lot lately, partly because of that conversation, partly because I just celebrated with another friend who recently quit a job that was draining them and partly because I realised somewhere along the way, I'd unintentionally unlearned something I once knew very well.</p>\n<p>That you can just do stuff.</p>"
