I said this to a friend earlier this week. They were describing how they felt in a situation that was not of their making.

But as they talked, I could hear something else beneath: a familiar kind of paralysis, a waiting for the right moment or the right permission or the right conditions.

The question isn't whether you're stuck. Lots of us get stuck, through circumstances we didn't choose and couldn't prevent. The question is: what separates people who find a way to move from people who stay stuck?

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, partly because of that conversation, partly because I just celebrated with another friend who recently quit a job that was draining them and partly because I realised somewhere along the way, I'd unintentionally unlearned something I once knew very well.

That you can just do stuff.
