And so, last night happened.</p>\n<p>And boy, it went deep. Product concepts with full technical architecture from Uchechukwu Onyeka. Find a cheeky Designers doing cool shit in his product 😅</p>\n<p>We shared techniques we're using in our work - like role playing with AI personas, feedback on visual direction, branding choices, market positioning.</p>\n<p>Safe conversations about what's working and what's not. What we're excited about and unsure of.</p>\n<p>I left feeling so at peace. So nourished. And convinced we need more nights/community like this. If you're interested in our next Designers doing cool shit, send me a message - tbc@iniabiodun.com</p>\n<img src=\"/DDCS.jpeg\" alt=\"DDCS\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/DDCS%202.jpg\" alt=\"DDCS 2\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/DDCS%203.jpg\" alt=\"DDCS 3\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"

    "content": "<p>Here's what Sophie had to say.</p>\n<p>Joined designers and researchers from Tesco, Lloyd's Bank, Cleo, and Jaguar Land Rover to discuss creativity beyond the brief—how we stay innovative within real-world constraints like legacy systems, slow organizational change, and the pressure to ship at speed.</p>\n<p>I spoke about building in public at Intercom, where the lines between design, research, and engineering have completely blurred. Shared how we're prototyping AI features with Claude and Cursor, sometimes shipping directly from what started as experiments—collapsing the distance between idea and validation from weeks to hours.</p>\n<p>Discussed my neurodivergent creative process: the stakeholder maps I build to read organizational dynamics, the systems I've designed to do what others do intuitively. Argued that constraints don't limit creativity—they redirect it. When you can't change the pace of organizational change, you make practice your competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>Closed on the philosophy behind In Good Company: your process is an act of generosity. The designers getting ahead aren't waiting for perfect conditions or formal permission. They're building in public, showing messy middles, creating luck surface area through visible practice.</p>\n<p>The advice I gave young designers: don't wait to design beyond the brief. Build the work you wish existed. Ship something imperfect this week. Practice is the new privilege—and the gap between those actively experimenting versus those waiting for permission is growing exponentially.</p>\n<img src=\"/Designing%20Futures.jpg\" alt=\"Designing Futures\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/Designing%20Futures%202.jpg\" alt=\"Designing Futures 2\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/Designing%20Futures%203.jpeg\" alt=\"Designing Futures 3\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"
