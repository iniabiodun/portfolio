    "content": "<p>Hosted an intimate gathering of designers building with AI outside of work—shipping things, experimenting, and learning in public together.</p>\n<p>What started as a casual mention at Intercom's AI Design Meetup became a deep evening of sharing. Sakky B offered to host, and the conversations went places I didn't expect. Product concepts with full technical architecture. Techniques we're using in our work, like role playing with AI personas, feedback on visual direction, branding choices, market positioning. Safe conversations about what's working and what's not.</p>\n<p>I left feeling nourished and convinced we need more nights like this. If you're interested in joining our next Designers Doing Cool Shit gathering, reach out at tbc@iniabiodun.com.</p>\n<img src=\"/DDCS.jpeg\" alt=\"DDCS\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/DDCS%202.jpg\" alt=\"DDCS 2\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/DDCS%203.jpg\" alt=\"DDCS 3\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"

    "content": "<p>Joined Sophie Aldebert's charitable UX event alongside designers and researchers from Tesco, Lloyd's Bank, Cleo, and Jaguar Land Rover to discuss creativity beyond the brief.</p>\n<p>We explored how to stay innovative within real-world constraints such as legacy systems, slow organisational change, and the pressure to ship at speed. I spoke about building in public at Intercom, where the lines between design, research, and engineering have completely blurred. Shared how we're prototyping AI features with Claude and Cursor, sometimes shipping directly from what started as experiments, collapsing the distance between idea and validation from weeks to hours.</p>\n<p>Discussed my neurodivergent creative process: the stakeholder maps I build to read organisational dynamics, the systems I've designed to do what others do intuitively. For me, constraints redirect creativity, not limit it.</p>\n<p>Closed on the philosophy behind In Good Company: your process is an act of generosity. The designers getting ahead aren't waiting for perfect conditions or formal permission. They're building in public, showing messy middles, creating luck surface area through visible practice.</p>\n<p>The advice I gave young designers: don't wait to design beyond the brief. Build the work you wish existed. Ship something imperfect this week.</p>\n<img src=\"/Designing%20Futures.jpg\" alt=\"Designing Futures\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/Designing%20Futures%202.jpg\" alt=\"Designing Futures 2\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/Designing%20Futures%203.jpeg\" alt=\"Designing Futures 3\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"

(Figma), Heldiney Pereira (Monzo), Ioana Teleanu (ex-Miro), Domingo Widen (Intercom), James Cash (Intercom), and Daria V. (Intercom). Punchy talks, live demos, and plenty of \"wait, can you show that again?\" moments as we explored what AI-powered design means today.</p>\n<p>The energy in the room was electric. Designers from across London came together to share what's working, what's breaking, and where this is all heading. Planning more of these.</p>\n<img src=\"/IDM2025.jpeg\" alt=\"IDM 2025\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/IDM%202025%201.jpeg\" alt=\"IDM 2025 1\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/IDM2025%202.jpeg\" alt=\"IDM 2025 2\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/Intercom%20AI%20Design%20Meetup.jpeg\" alt=\"Intercom AI Design Meetup\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"

That human layer of emotional intelligence is the real work.</p>\n<p>Without it, teams over-index on automation and slide straight back into order-taker mode.

Showcased how Intercom's design team ships production-ready code and prototypes using AI tools, including Staff Product Designer Domingo's banner audit, a script that parsed 700+ component variations in hours versus weeks manually.</p>\n<p>Walked through the complete Fin Voice design process from concept to shipped product, demonstrating the workflow from Midjourney visual exploration to V0 prototyping to Cursor WebGL development. Showed how working prototypes shifted stakeholder conversations from \"should we build?\" to \"when can we ship?\"</p>\n<p>Shared personal projects as practice: Pattern Generator (a custom tool built in Lovable for Youth Agency rebrand), Aivie (a medical living history app for chronic illness management), and the Maya Angelou Project (collaborating with my 6-year-old daughter using Claude voice mode).</p>\n<p>Covered the AI tool stack like Claude, Cursor, V0, Distill, Perplexity, and addressed the human cost: themed work days, intentional boundaries, and scheduling learning into work hours.</p>\n<p>Ran a workshop helping attendees write their first AI-assisted prototype brief, focusing on what to test, who needs to see it, and what conversation it will unlock.</p>\n<p>Core principles shared: claiming permission (build prototypes before seeking approval), tight feedback loops (bring stakeholders in earlier), compounding leverage (one prototype unlocks multiple conversations), practice over privilege (consistent daily practice compounds over time), and generous knowledge sharing (document and share prompts, processes, and failures).</p>\n<p>If you're interested in this type of session for your design team, reach out at tbc@iniabiodun.com.</p>\n<img src=\"/Tesco%20Design%20Team%20Session%202.PNG\" alt=\"Tesco Design Team Session\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/Tesco%20Design%20Team%20Session1%202.PNG\" alt=\"Tesco Design Team Session 1\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<img src=\"/Tesco%20Feedback%201%20Final%202.PNG\" alt=\"Tesco Feedback\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />"

The ability to experiment and make meaning with AI is fast becoming a new baseline for design practice. Beneath the tooling and the hype, the work that holds teams together is emotional literacy, curiosity, and strategic translation. The kind of pre-work that keeps design human.</p>\n<p>Together, we'll explore how influence, leadership, and collaboration have been rewired inside modern teams. We'll examine how the work beneath the work (listening, translating, aligning, questioning, both between humans as well as between humans and machines) is what will allow new technology to create genuine progress.</p>\n<p>The future of design won't belong to the fastest teams, but to the ones who move together, guided by curiosity, even as the world around them accelerates.</p>\n<img src=\"/Throughline%20Conf.png\" alt=\"Throughline Conference\" class=\"w-full my-8 rounded-lg\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://www.throughlineconf.com/speakers/inioluwa-abiodun\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visit event page</a></p>"
